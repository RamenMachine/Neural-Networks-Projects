Average (MA) system: smooths high-frequency content (cos 0.95 attenuated).
Difference system: emphasizes transitions / high-frequency content (cos 0.95 retained, low freq reduced).
Constant input -> MA yields ramp to constant plateau, difference yields impulse at boundaries.
Composite signal -> MA smooths envelope, difference highlights rapid oscillations.
